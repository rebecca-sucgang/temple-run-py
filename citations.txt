Below the dashed line, include easily understandable and verifiable 
citations to all the major sources you used for your project, as described
in the TP document: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/term-project-and-hack112.html#tp-policies

In addition, your code must also include citations directly in the code that 
make it clear where you use code that is partly or entirely not of your 
original design, and what the source is for that code.

Overall:
We used ChatGPT as a TA, to guide us in debugging.  
We also researched into sprites 

Pranav:
William Li (TA) helped me write code for the leadership board during OH (the idea was mine though, and I tried to write it but got stuck)
ChatGPT provided guidance in terms of storing the game score and providing data regarding past 3 sources (even after exiting and restarting the app)

Rebecca:
ChatGPT provided guidance for how to create sprite sheets and helped me write the code for the player sprites.
Similarly, I used ChatGPT to provide guidance for how to integrate images into the code for my UI design.

Indu:
Used YouTube (link in mazecopy.py) to learn about DFS algorithm and gain knowledge of how to create one
Debugged DFS algorithm with ChatGPT (the exact line is in the code)
ChatGPT with app.mazesSolved
Quit + Solve Button made with ChatGPT (used a dictionary to organize!)
